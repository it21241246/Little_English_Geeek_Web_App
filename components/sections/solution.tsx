        Solution

      <div className="text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300 mb-12">
        To address the challenges identified in Sri Lankaâ€™s primary English education landscape
        including poor reading comprehension, limited teacher-student interaction, and low adoption of educational technology.This research
        proposes a web-based Reading and Comprehension Assistant Tool. The solution is designed to be child-friendly, curriculum-aligned, and
        locally adaptable. This intelligent assistant integrates speech processing, adaptive learning, and gamification to offer a rich,
        interactive learning experience for students while also supporting teachers with automated assessment and feedback tools.
      </div>
      <li className="text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300 mb-12">Real-Time Fluency & Pronunciation Feedback:
        Using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and forced alignment, the system listens to students read aloud and provides immediate feedback on:
        Mispronunciations, disfluencies (pauses, hesitations), word substitutions or omissions.
        This helps students self-monitor and correct their oral reading, fostering confidence and fluency all without needing constant teacher input.</li>
      <li className="text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300 mb-12">Adaptive Comprehension Question Generation & Evaluation:
        The system intelligently generates: short-answer questions to test literal and inferential understanding, jumbled sentence tasks to reinforce
        syntax and structure, student responses are evaluated using natural language understanding (NLU) models. THis offer; instant feedback on correctness,
        suggestions or hints for partially correct answers,d ynamic adaptation of difficulty level based on performance</li>
      <li className="text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300 mb-12">Image Description for Language Enrichment:Students can view AI-generated or
        curated educational images and are prompted to: Describe what they see,  use targeted vocabulary and sentence structures,
        practice creative and descriptive writing.This activity builds contextual language use, encourages expression, and supports visual-spatial learners.</li>

      <li className="text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300 mb-12">Gamified Vocabulary Challenges: To sustain motivation, the platform includes
        interactive games such as: Word-matching and spelling games ,level-up rewards and achievement badges. These elements promote active learning,
        improve word retention, and increase student engagement, especially in younger learners with shorter attention spans.</li>

      <li className="text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300 mb-12">The system is not just student-centric. Tis also reduces teacher workload by: Automatically tracking learner progress</li>
